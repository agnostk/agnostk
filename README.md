## Hi there, I'm <ins>Felipe</ins> aka. *agnostk* !

> **Agnostk** as in [Language-agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic), and not as in [Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism).

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in **Tokyo, Japan** 🇯🇵.

My journey started at age 9 making Flash games for my friends, and evolved into architecting distributed systems for global enterprises. Over the years, I expanded my horizons to explore a variety of domains, including web & mobile development, game dev, robotics, automation, DevOps and data science & data engineering.

My passion for programming has driven me to prioritize **software architecture principles** over specific syntax. This allows me to adapt to any tech stack, solving real-world problems with the best tools available. I am always eager to learn and adapt to new methodologies in the ever-evolving tech industry.
